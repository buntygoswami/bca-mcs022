 1) what is telnet?
  ->  Telnet, developed in 1969, is a protocol that provides a command line interface for communication with a remote device or server.  
  ->  Telnet stands for Teletype Network, but it can also be used as a verb; 'to telnet' is to establish a connection using the telnet protocol.
  -> Because it was developed before the mainstream adaptation of the internet, telnet does not employ any form of encryption.	

 2) How does Telnet work?	
   -> Telnet provides users with a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication system utilizing a virtual terminal connection over 8 byte.
   -> User data is interspersed in-band with telnet control information over the transmission control protocol (TCP).
   -> Often, Telnet was used on a terminal to execute functions remotely.
   -> The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering Telnet into a command prompt by following this syntax: telnet hostname port.         The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands into the Telnet prompt. To end a session and log off, the user ends a Telnet            command with Telnet.



 2) difference between telnet and rlogin? 
 
    --> The most major difference between rlogin and telnet is in the way that rlogin allows the credentials of the client to be stored in a local rhosts file so that 		the just needs to access the remote server and he is connected automatically. The client program passes the credentials automatically. This can be both for 		password and username or password only. The problem with this is that leaving a terminal unattended leaves not only that terminal vulnerable but also all the 		other remote computers that has entries in the local rhosts file. It is not implemented in telnet, thus there is no risk of exposing the server to unnecessary 		risk.

  	 --> Telnet allows the user to pass environment variables as parameters while Rlogin does not
  	 --> Rlogin allows the user to automatically connect while Telnet does not
   	 --> Both rlogin and telnet are not secure enough for public use

4) Encrypting File System (EFS)?

   -> An Encrypting File System (EFS) is a functionality of the New Technology File System (NTFS) found on various versions of Microsoft Windows. EFS facilitates the         transparent encryption and decryption of files by making use of complex, standard cryptographic algorithms.
   -> The cryptographic algorithms are used in EFS to provide useful security countermeasures.
   ->   whereby only the intended recipient can decipher the cryptography. EFS uses symmetric and asymmetric keys during the encryption process, but it does not 		protect Data transmissions. Rather, it protects data files within systems. Even if someone has access to a certain computer, whether authorized or not, he 		still cannot unlock the EFS cryptography without the secret key.	

5) what is TFTP?
   -> trivial is a file transfer protocol used to read or write file/mail from or on remote server.
   -> trivial file transfer protocol is use UDP (user datagram protocol) to transport data from one end to another end.
   -> tftp and ftp is very simple in design and has limited features as compared to File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
   -> TFTP provides no authentication and security while transferring files. 
   -> Its lack of security also makes it dangerous for use over the Internet.
   -> TFTP is very useful for boot computers and devices that do not have hard disk drives or storage devices 
      because it can easily be implemented using a small amount of memory.
   -> Data transfer through TFTP is usually initiated through port 69.

6) difference between ftp vs tftp? 
   1) It is simpler than FTP, does file transfer between client and server process
       but does not provide user authentication and other useful features supported by FTP.
   2) As TFTP is unreliable protocol due to UDP,but ftp uses TCP as transport layer protocol.
   3) TFTP sends one block and waits on acknowledgement before sending another block.
   3) ftp uses TCP port numbers 20 and 21. but tftp use udp port number 69.
   4) FTP uses robust control commands.	TFTP uses simple control commands.
   5) ftp sends data over a separate TCP connection from control commands.	 
      tftp uses no connections because UDP is connectionless protocol. 
   6) ftp requires more memory and programming effort.	tftp requires less memory and programming effort.	
   7) ftp  specified in RFC959 document.	but tftp specified in RFC783 document.
   
7)  OSI Layer.
    -> it process data over seven  layer. 
    -> Each Layer in the OSI model does the job for the previous layer also adds prefixes information termed as "header".
    -> The data link layer adds suffixes called cyclic redundancy check as "trailer" which is used for error detection.
    
     [ Physical Layer -> data link layer -> Network layer ->  transport layer -> session layer -> presentation layer -> application layer]
     let us discuss each one by  one more Detail -> http://www.rfwireless-world.com/images/OSI_TCPIP.JPG
     
     1)  Application Layer : 
        -> All the applications for user reside at this layer. It includes FTP, Telnet, e-mail etc.
     2) Presentation Layer :
        -> It formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network. 
        -> Its basic task is to make application layer and network layer talk to each other by processing the data.
     3) Session Layer :
        -> It Provides control mechanism to connect two applications running on different machines.
        -> It covers basic function to establish, to maintain and to release connections.
     4) Transport Layer :
       -> It assures reliable data communication between two hosts.
       ->  It is responsible for error recovery and flow control between two hosts.
       -> It also does multiplexing and de multiplexing functionalities for transmitting and receiving host respectively.
     
     5) Network Layer :
       -> The main function is switching and routing of the packet. 
       -> It adds logical addressing to do this. It also takes care of error handling, congestion control and packet sequencing.
     
     6) Data Link Layer :
        -> It takes care of errors in the physical layer.
        -> It provides flow control and also does frame synchronization. 
        -> ARQ is implemented to take care of retransmission in case of erroneous packets. 
        -> In latest today's technologies it provides Medium Access Control functionality, hence known as MAC. 
        
     7) Physical Layer :
        -> It mainly takes care of bit stream transmission over physical medium (cable, air etc.). 
        -> It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data through cable or wireless medium.
        
  
  
8)  Windows 2000 File Replication Service (FRS) ? 
   -> The File Replication service (FRS) is a multi-threaded, multi-master replication engine 
      that replaces the LMREPL (LAN Manager Replication) service in Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.x and 4.0.
   -> Windows 2000 domain controllers and servers use FRS to replicate system policies 
      and login scripts for Windows 2000 and down-level clients.   
   -> FRS can also replicate content between Windows 2000 servers hosting the
      same fault-tolerant Distributed File System (DFS) roots or child node replicas.    
      
      
9)  What is NTFS file system ? 
   -> NTFS is an acronym for NT File System or New Technology File System and refers to a file system 
      used by the operating system to identify how files are stored, named 
      and organized on a hard-disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), USB memory stick, 
      microSD card and other similar storage devices.
   -> NTFS is a reliable file system.
   -> It offers security.
   -> It can use file compression to increase the free storage space available on a disk. 
   -> It allows you to use mounted volumes, which means that you can access disk volumes as regular folders in your files system.
   -> NTFS can regain free space from sparse files, by monitoring the consecutive large areas of zeros from files on the disk.
   -> NTFS has journaling, which means that it keeps a log of the files added, modified or deleted on a drive.
   -> The NTFS file system should be faster than FAT32.

5) Introduction to 5 Common Network Devices
    1) Hub 2) Switch 3) Router 4) Firewall 5) Wireless Access Point
     1) HUB:- I have to be honest here, the hub is old school technology and not really used in modern networks. 
              Iâ€™ve included it here because you may run into it occasionally, but also because it is helpful in 
               the next section (the switch) if you know what a hub is. A hub is a device that simply spits out data 
               it receives on one interface to all its other interfaces.  So, if a packet of data arrives on 
               interface 1 of an 8 port hub, the hub will blindly copy that data out the interfaces 2 through 8. This was useful
               in the early days.  It was a cheep and quick way to link up multiple computers.  The problem with hubs though 
               is that only one computer can talk at a time.  If two computers talked at the same time, their traffic 
               would get combined as it was echoed out the other interfaces.  This is called a collision, and it would corrupt 
               the data being transmitted by both computers. So, each computer would have to try again, after a random time period.  
               This becomes a real problem when the network gets busy or when more then a hand full of computers are on a network. 
               A switch solves the collision issue.
